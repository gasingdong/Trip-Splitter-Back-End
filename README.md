## Local Development
To run the server for local development, you will need to install dependencies:
```
yarn install | npm install
```
And then you can start the server either normally or for development:
```
normal: yarn start | npm run start
dev: yarn server | npm run server
```
To run the application tests:
```
yarn test | npm run test
```
The server will default to run on port 5000. To set the server to a different port, you will need to configure the `PORT` configuration in the environment variables.
